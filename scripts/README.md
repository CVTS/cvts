Convenience scripts mostly useful for dev.

- **convert.py**: Python script for making sure the example data is
  appropriately anonymised.

- **setup-valhalla.sh**: Automation script for building Valhalla. This is
  pretty specific to the state of the world at a particular point in time
  and will likely need twerking to work at any other.

- **start-docker-postgres.sh**: Script for starting a local Postgres
  instances in docker.
